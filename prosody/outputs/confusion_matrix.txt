Confusion Matrix for 0:
True Negatives (TN): 630
False Positives (FP): 73
False Negatives (FN): 103
True Positives (TP): 1312

Interpretation:
  - The model correctly predicted that '0' is NOT present 630 times (TN).
  - The model incorrectly predicted that '0' is present 73 times when it was actually NOT present (FP).
  - The model incorrectly predicted that '0' is NOT present 103 times when it was actually present (FN).
  - The model correctly predicted that '0' is present 1312 times (TP).

Confusion Matrix for 2:
True Negatives (TN): 1677
False Positives (FP): 119
False Negatives (FN): 67
True Positives (TP): 255

Interpretation:
