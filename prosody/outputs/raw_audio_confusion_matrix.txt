Confusion Matrix for 0:
True Negatives (TN): 535
False Positives (FP): 168
False Negatives (FN): 96
True Positives (TP): 1319

Interpretation:
  - The model correctly predicted that '0' is NOT present 535 times (TN).
  - The model incorrectly predicted that '0' is present 168 times when it was actually NOT present (FP).
  - The model incorrectly predicted that '0' is NOT present 96 times when it was actually present (FN).
  - The model correctly predicted that '0' is present 1319 times (TP).
