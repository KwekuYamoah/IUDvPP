Confusion Matrix for 0:
True Negatives (TN): 531
False Positives (FP): 172
False Negatives (FN): 90
True Positives (TP): 1325

Interpretation:
  - The model correctly predicted that '0' is NOT present 531 times (TN).
  - The model incorrectly predicted that '0' is present 172 times when it was actually NOT present (FP).
  - The model incorrectly predicted that '0' is NOT present 90 times when it was actually present (FN).
  - The model correctly predicted that '0' is present 1325 times (TP).
