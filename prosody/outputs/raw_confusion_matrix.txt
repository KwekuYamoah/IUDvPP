Confusion Matrix for 0:
True Negatives (TN): 703
False Positives (FP): 0
False Negatives (FN): 0
True Positives (TP): 1415

Interpretation:
  - The model correctly predicted that '0' is NOT present 703 times (TN).
  - The model incorrectly predicted that '0' is present 0 times when it was actually NOT present (FP).
  - The model incorrectly predicted that '0' is NOT present 0 times when it was actually present (FN).
  - The model correctly predicted that '0' is present 1415 times (TP).
