Their mild prosody values show they are important for orientation but secondary to the main directive.\n\u2022 Clear Directive with Minimal Detail or Avoidance Intent: The consistent prosody without abrupt or high-stress emphasis suggests a straightforward instruction.

This suggests that the action is not emphasized or is possibly implied rather than directly commanded.\n2. Goal-Intent Objects \u2013 The words \u201cbook\u201d and \u201cmarks\u201d have prosody vectors of [0.0, 0.0] and [823.3850429972169, 0.03532080798511267], respectively. The lack of emphasis on \u201cbook\u201d suggests it is not a primary focus, while the high magnitude on \u201cmarks\u201d indicates it is a significant object of interest.\n3. Detail-Intent Objects \u2013 The word \u201cstand\u201d has a prosody vector of [0.0, 0.0], indicating it is not emphasized, suggesting it is a contextual detail rather than a primary focus.\n4.

Positional and Spatial Cues \u2013 Words like \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cnear\u201d have high prosody magnitudes, indicating their importance in specifying spatial relationships:\n   \u2022 \u201cfrom\u201d: [1076.501960599674, 0.032750846791973265]\n   \u2022 \u201cnear\u201d: [830.0241505073615, 0.024686515107493912]\n   These values suggest that these words are crucial for understanding the spatial context of the task, helping to locate the objects in relation to each other.\n\n4. Supporting Words \u2013 Functional words like \u201cthe\u201d have varying prosody magnitudes, indicating their structural role without significant emphasis:\n   \u2022 \u201cthe\u201d: [865.7411739859999, 0.035277181890428534] and [0.0, 0.0]\n   This variation shows that while these words are necessary for sentence structure, they do not carry interpretive weight.\n\nProsody Vector Analysis:\n\u2022 Goal-Intent Objects: The high prosody values on \u201cmug,\u201d \u201ctable,\u201d and \u201csink\u201d emphasize these as the main objects of focus. The listener understands these as the critical elements of the task.\n\u2022 Spatial Context: The high prosody on \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cnear\u201d indicates their importance in defining the spatial relationships between the objects, guiding the listener to understand the positioning of the \u201cmug\u201d in relation to the \u201ctable\u201d and \u201csink.\u201d\n\u2022 Implied Action: The zero prosody on \u201cbring\u201d suggests that the action is understood or implied, possibly due to the context or familiarity with the task.\n\nOverall Inference of Intent:\nThe prosody vectors collectively indicate:\n\u2022 Focus on Objects: The high prosody magnitudes on \u201cmug,\u201d \u201ctable,\u201d and \u201csink\u201d highlight these as the primary objects of interest, guiding the listener to focus on these elements.\n\u2022 Spatial Relationships: The emphasis on \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cnear\u201d provides crucial spatial context, helping the listener understand the positioning of the objects.\n\u2022 Implied Action: The lack of emphasis on \u201cbring\u201d suggests that the action is understood or implied, possibly due to the context or familiarity with the task.\n\nExplanation: I understand that I need to focus on the mug, table, and sink. The mug is located on the table, which is near the sink. I will go to the table, pick up the mug, and bring it to the sink.\n\nResolved referents with spatial predicates: [\"mug::isnear(table::isnear(sink))\"]\nIn my plan, I will always stick to \"mug::isnear(table::isnear(sink))\" whenever I need to reference the mug.\n\nTask plan:\n1. goto[table::isnear(sink)]\n2. pick[mug::isnear(table::isnear(sink))]\n3. goto[sink]\n4. place[mug::isnear(table::isnear(sink)),sink]"
